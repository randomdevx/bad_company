Sayani: whrees iT?

Sayani: mm
sad123456789: meowwww
sad123456789: sayaniii
Sayani: what a beautiful page it is !!!!!!!!
Sayani: nice pics O_O
khan: thats this file we are editing here
khan: easier to quickly check if its an item we are missing with the pics there
sad123456789: what pics
khan: did u read what i wrote?
Sayani: yes
sad123456789: we should fish...
Sayani: adverfull has such a loong list!!
Sayani: and marta too!!!
khan: ikr he has almost everything and marta
sad123456789: ??
sad123456789: i'm confused
Sayani: yeah so if a person already has some decos,that means he/she needs to buy the others with 500 fb from club members right?
Sayani: buying means insurance price i know,so after the process,can we get back the money?
khan: not exactly... the idea is when we complete a set we gather the set and start passing the set among members so we can go fishing the unlocked fish
Sayani: yeah so if I have something,i need not to take it from others right?
khan: yes when you 'buy' the set from the one who has it u pay him 6k for the 12 items... then when u finish fishing u pass it the same way to another member getting ur 6k back
Sayani: but if i already have 3/4 items among 12,then ??
khan: u still 'should' buy the entire set so it doesnt get lost by the time u pass it to the next member
khan: u might have 3/4 but the person u will give the set back might not...
Sayani: oh okay ;))))thanks for clearing it khan :DDD
khan: :)
Sayani: so whatever we have,we would just gather and then distribute and then went back at first stage :)
khan: yes whatever u gather will still be yours at the end of the process .... plus having been able to unlock and catch the fishes
Sayani: yeah awsome :)
Sayani: so from now i should keep 6k fb asap!!!
khan: yes... dont u have more than that?
Sayani: :( no :(
Sayani: 1k only :( m poor :(
khan: :o go gather some shells
khan: less than 1000 shells will get u 6kk
Sayani: yay :)) i have 1800 shells ^_^
Sayani:
khan: then u are rich
Sayani: :D
Sayani: yay
khan: ok ladies im off for dinner

Bad Company: I added something from Esraa
Bad Company: --------
k: are u here?
Bad Company: i am writting simewns things
Bad Company: --- done with simewn for now
k: ok
Bad Company: he sold his doubles to by unque
k: to who
Bad Company: simewn
k: he sold it to by what
Bad Company: he had some X2.. they are gone now
k: oh ok
k: what happened?
k: is it me or the file is not there
k: ok i restored it
Bad Company: there was a Sara here
Bad Company: we got more than one owners.. for things :)
k: ok i updated github ... ask her if her changes are reflected there
k: i updated the rules too...
Sayani: i wanna add two decos though very common :(
k: and yes about several owners... but we will chose just 1 per set..
Bad Company: se is o on fisaot
Bad Company: she is not on fishao now
k: what?
k: let me know what u guys think of the rules and the structure to trade
Sayani: its absolutely fine
Bad Company: we might have to have 2-3 similar lines for one item
Bad Company: example 3 people have baloon chair and 3 people at the same time borrow it
Bad Company: but borrow it from a different person
Bad Company: we need to write the User's name too that borrows the think
Bad Company: thing
k: no because the idea is that just 1 person will be wit the set at a given moment in time
Bad Company: so we know where it ended
Bad Company: ok.. each day a different person?
k: the renter table is for the person who has it at the moment and until when
Bad Company: i think you start gothering balloon set as a whole
k: each day or for as long as the person 'rented' it...
Bad Company: so all borrows it from a certain person
Sayani: how many days will a member get to catch that particular fish with a complete set?
k: yes, from all the options we have (members with same items) we will probably just use 1 of theirs... so we can gather 1 set (since rare items will probably be just 1)
Bad Company: sayani 400 cherries how many days?
Sayani: ??
Bad Company: u need 400 the most cherries to catch it
Bad Company: for the balllooon set i m talking
Sayani: ohh okay got it
k: no listen u rent the set for 1 day or for as many days as u need and u go catch the fish.... if u cant catch it u can always get in the queue list again
Bad Company: now if someone cant catch it its not the people that rents the item fault
k: true
Bad Company: we might catch it in 1 hour and then find another person to pass it on
Bad Company: so we might finish earlier
Sayani: and that depends on if that two person are online that time!
Bad Company: we find the first available online
Sayani: same time i mean
Sayani: oh
Bad Company: who ever is not online just waits more
Sayani: thats better
k: no listen we have aqueue list for that reason
Sayani: ooh
k: is not whoever zoi... its the person in the queue list
Bad Company: we cant do anything for example for lil prinnie that is dissapeared for 11 days
Sayani: right
k: zoi we have a queue list for that reason... the person wanting to get the set has to get in the queue list
Bad Company: and she didnt leave a notice to anyone
Bad Company: ok
k: look at the update i made to the file in the bottom
Sayani: we have to get ourself enlisted in that queue list?
Bad Company: yes
k: theres a table for "Renter, From, To"
Sayani: yes
k: the idea is that if u want the set u get in the queue list
k: in other words we wont force no one to get the set ... its just if u want u get in the queue period
Sayani: ooh so we have to type our names when we think we are able to catch that fish and pass the set forward.
Bad Company: this has to be done now
Bad Company: tommorow i ll have an answer from Relliano
Sayani: right but i have a question khan and zoi..
k: yes u type ur name and the date from/to u plan to fish for it... and when ur time expires u check thenext person in the queue and thats the one u have to trade with
Bad Company: to procceed with the items
Sayani: should I have a strong rod for that 5 * fishes?what do u suggest khan and zoi?
Bad Company: we get the guarantee of 500fb from the next person?
Bad Company: for each item?
k: the 500fb rule is gone...
Bad Company: why?
k: because now we gonna let each owner decide whats their insurance and their rent
Sayani: O_O
k: we obviously will prioritize those that have small insurance and no rent
Bad Company: khan yu change the rules in the middle of the thing
k: its because u know some items are like really really expensive.. so we cant tell others their items insurance is just 500fb
Bad Company: i quit this parody if you change the rules
k: i didnt change them... i updated them to face the adversity we have...
Bad Company: we all had agreeed to it
Bad Company: i d better wait them to get mine.. bye
Sayani: oooh!she left!
k: lol why would she get mad? childish ...
k: u understand me sayani or am i wrong?
Sayani: yes i understand u khan..its right that rare deocs demand more than 500 fb
k: yeah and its not like im saying mine will be more expensive... i dont care about mine.... but other ppls i cant decide for theirs...
k: and im bringing this change of rules because she got this relliano guy with those suggestions not m
Sayani: wh is this relliano?
Sayani: who*
k: idk some friend of her that is willing to loan us some rare items but he wants high insurance and rent as well
Sayani: yes zoi just told me he wants 30 k total as guarantee insuarance for the whole club !!!!
k: yeah lol and i dont know why she gets mad because im adapting the rules to match those needs lol
Sayani: yes :D
Sayani: but one more thing
Sayani: suppose u rent me some rare deco along with other 11 items of a set.so i give u 1k fb as a rent ..after catching my fish,if i now pass it to esraa and she doesn't agree to give that much amount of money to me (1k ) then? i mean for a single amount,we should maintain a particular price..Isn't it?
k: right.. if u dont get the same amount of insurance then u dont need to trade
k: the person in the queue is supposed to be able to pay for the total cost which should be the same as u paid and i paid (rent is not included tho in case there is rent)
Sayani: right and there would be difference between our thoughts.so its natural that this arguments can arise
Sayani: oooh
k: yeah i wrote on top that these rules are bound to change by everone's suggestiosn or ideas... those rules are not written in stone
Sayani: written in heart :D
k: exactly :) i want fairness but certainties that no one will get screwed either
Sayani: yes and its better to fix all these arguments and debates before we start trading.then the process will be faster
k: exactly but she leaves... lol as if im saying its gonna stay like that.... hahaha... why not talk and debate why she thinks its a bad idea
Sayani: i think if u pm her in fishao,she will get it again :)))
