## Hi Bad Company Members!

This is a page for Factory Deco you have and want to make available for the club members. Write your name and the items below. 

The main idea is to collectively complete the furniture sets, so we can take turns with the set to catch the fish in the factory. Then the furniture set is traded to another member.

The rules to get in the queue list for a set are as follow:
* Every item traded shall return to its original owner when all the members catch the unlocked fish or the queue list is empty.
* There will be a queue list for members to request a given set of furniture. A period of time will be assigned for the furniture in your possession, in which you should catch the unlocked fish or you will have to request again to be placed in the queue list.
* Every item should be traded for a price of 500 fb as an insurance. This does not mean you own the item. That said, the player requesting a queue for a set should have 6k fb available.

#### Notes
> - This is a draft for the procedure we think should be followed. If there are suggestions or a better way to go about sharing to avoid issues later on write your ideas below.
> - If you guys are currently able or in the position to trade with other players for items that we collectively don't have, with items that several members currently have, it could be convenient for the club and you in particular. There seem to be items that are more rare than others and most players in the game aren't aware of these stats. We can see a pattern develop here though. The most rare items are likely to be expensive over time.

Thank you
Zoitsa, Khan

# QUEUE LIST PER FURNITURE SET

### Trade guidelines: 
* Remember, the insurance price per item is 500 fb. Each set is 12 items, meaning 6k fb total.
* The member in current possession of the set is responsible for trading the set to the next member in the queue list.
* BEFORE any trade, an in-game confirmation message should be sent by Zoitsa/Khan. Without this confirmation the trade of the set shouldn't happen to avoid forgery.
* AFTER the trade is completed, a confirmation message from each member (receiver/sender) should be sent to Zoitsa/Khan.
